# Freelance Project: Dynamic Web Application

## Description
This project is a dynamic web application developed using JSP (JavaServer Pages), Servlets, MySQL, JDBC, and Ajax. It was created as a freelance project to deliver a robust and interactive solution tailored to specific client requirements.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system utilizing JSP and Servlets for handling user sessions and credentials.
- **Database Integration:** MySQL is used as the database to store and manage user data, with JDBC for seamless data connectivity and transactions.
- **Dynamic Content:** JSPs are employed to render dynamic content based on user interactions and data retrieved from the MySQL database.
- **Real-time Updates:** AJAX is used to enhance user experience by allowing asynchronous data loading and interaction without needing to reload the entire page.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for managing data, provided through Servlets and JSPs.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaServer Pages (JSP):** For dynamic web content rendering.
- **Java Servlets:** To handle requests and responses, manage sessions, and process business logic.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system for data storage.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** API for connecting and executing queries with the MySQL database.
- **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):** For asynchronous web requests, improving page responsiveness and user interaction.
